# IOT-Social-Distancing-Monitoring-For-Queue

Social distancing is of key importance during the current pandemic. It helps limit the spread of covid by observing distance between disease spreading individuals. Now it is not possible to station a person 24Ã—7 at each queue to monitor social distancing violations. Banks, Public Offices, Malls, Schools, Theatres etc usually see long queues for hours every day. To ensure social distancing in queues we hereby design a social distancing monitoring robot. The system consists of a some sensors which will continuously monitoring the distance between persons. It makes use of a line following principle to constantly move along with the queue and monitor for social distancing violations. This system uses IR sensing to travel along with the queue to and fro in order to detect violations. The system is now equipped with obstacle detecting ultrasonic sensor in order to detect obstacles in the vehicle path. The system uses another ultrasonic sensor for detecting distance between 2 individuals in a queue. It any 2 individuals are found having less than 3 feet distance between them, the system instantly sounds a buzzer and alert to inform about the violation. Also it sends alerts of these using wifi over iot to inform the higher authorities/head office to update them about violations. Thus this project allows for automatic maintaining social distancing in queues to help prevent spread of the virus.
